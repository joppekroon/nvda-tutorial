		The Fellowship of the Ring, from <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> by J.R.R. Tolkien, consisted of 9 characters from
		multiple races.

		<h3>Istari</h3>
		Only one of the Istari, or more commonly Wizards, took part in the Fellowship.

		<h4>Gandalf the Grey</h4>
		Gandalf was the de-facto leader of the Fellowship, but fell while protecting the other companions from the Balrog in
		Moria.

		<h3>Elves</h3>
		Although multiple elves were highly involved in the adventures in the books, only one took part in the Fellowship.

		<h4>Legolas</h4>
		After the fall of Gandalf, Legolas led the Fellowship to Lothlórien. During the events of the books he became
		friends with Gimli, an unusual occurance for an elf and a dwarf.

		<h3>Humans</h3>
		There were two humans that took part in the Fellowship.

		<h4>Boromir</h4>
		Son of the steward of Gondor, Boromir attempted to persuade the Council in Rivendell to allow him to use the Ring to
		defend his country. Although he accepted the Councils decision, he only understood it shortly before his ultimate
		death.

		<h4>Aragorn</h4>
		Although first introduced as Strider, a simple ranger, Aragorn was revealed to be the heir of Isildur, the king of
		Gondor.

		<h3>Dwarves</h3>
		The race of Dwarves is in strong decline by the events of the Lord of the Rings, yet one dwarf participates in the
		Fellowship.

		<h4>Gimli</h4>
		Gimli is the son of Glóin, one of the members of the company in <cite>The Hobbit</cite>. He develops a friendship
		with Legolas during their adventures, overcoming an ancient enmity between Dwarves and Elves.

		<h3>Hobbits</h3>
		Although Hobbits are an unasuming race within Middle-Earth, the ring-bearer is a Hobbit and thus he and his friends
		all take part in the Fellowship.

		<h4>Frodo</h4>
		Having received the Ring as a gift from his uncle Bilbo, the ring seemed to have little effect on him. Yet
		ultimately he succumbed to the Ring.

		<h4>Sam</h4>
		Frodo's gardener. Sam was the only member of the Fellowship that accompanied Frodo all the way to Mount Doom.

		<h4>Pippin</h4>
		Conspires with Merry to accompany Frodo to Rivendell, and from there continues to travel with him as part of the
		Fellowship.
		Inadvertently getting captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai with Merry allowing Sam and Frodo to escape.

		<h4>Merry</h4>
		Merry is instrumental in the defeat of the Witch-king of Angmar by stabbing him behind the knee, allowing Eowyn to
		deliver the killing blow.
