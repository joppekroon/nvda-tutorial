				A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to
				bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said, “Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with
				her.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Sharp’s the word,” said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But when they
				had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the Library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and
				realized that Mrs Macready must be bringing her party of sightseers up the back stairs – instead of up the front
				stairs as they had expected. And after that – whether it was that they lost their heads, or that Mrs Macready
				was
				trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia they
				seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere, until at last Susan said, “Oh bother those trippers! Here –
				let’s get into the Wardrobe Room till they’ve passed. No one will follow us in there.”
