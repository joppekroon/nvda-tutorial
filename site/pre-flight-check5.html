	<h1>NVDA key</h1>

	<p>
		Instead of repeatedly pressing <kbd aria-label="arrow down">↓</kbd>, you can tell NVDA to start reading with
		<kbd>NVDA</kbd> + <kbd aria-label="arrow down">↓</kbd> until you tell it to stop again with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> or any
		other command.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default the <kbd>NVDA</kbd> key is <kbd>Insert</kbd>, but this can be changed to <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> in the
		settings, which can be useful for reduced keyboard layouts like in some laptops.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, if you need to review what was said, <kbd>NVDA</kbd> + <kbd aria-label="arrow up">↑</kbd> will read the
		current line again.
	</p>

			members of society, as possible. For particulars, as everyone knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities
			are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers, but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone
			of society.

			‘Tomorrow,’ he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, ‘you’ll be settling down to serious
			work. You won’t have time for generalities. Meanwhile&hellip;’

			Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse’s mouth into the note-book. The boys scribbled like mad.
